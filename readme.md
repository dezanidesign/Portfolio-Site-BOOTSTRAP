Second version of my portfolio site, this time using Bootstrap 4.

Went similar but not completely same as original portfolio site, began to discover better ways of styling and potential new ways to layout the site. Will come back and experiment more when I have the free time.

Also found making the page responsive much easier with Bootstrap.

Still need to familiraise myself with more of bootstrap, begin to memorise through practice. Potential to create sites quickly is quite exciting.

Plan to commit more with following projects.
